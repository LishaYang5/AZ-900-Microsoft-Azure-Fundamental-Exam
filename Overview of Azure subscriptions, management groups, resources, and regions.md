### Resources.

 Resources are instances of services that you create like Virtual Machines, Storage, or Sequel databases. 

### Resource groups

Resources are combined into resource groups which act as a logical container into which Azure
resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts are deployed and managed. 

### Subscriptions

 A subscription groups together user accounts and the resources that had been created by those user accounts. For each subscription, there are limits or quotas on the amount of resources that you
can create and use. Organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and the resources
that are created by users, teams, or projects. 

### Management groups

These groups help you manage access, policy, and compliance for multiple subscriptions. All subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group. You'll examine each of these four organizational levels in detail.
