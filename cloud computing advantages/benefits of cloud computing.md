Hello and welcome to Azure
fundamental concepts in architectural components. In this module, you'll learn
about the main concepts of Cloud computing and how Azure
implements these concepts. We will also see in our case
study how Tailwind Traders can benefit from migrating to a Cloud computing environment. More specifically, after
completing this lesson, you will identify benefits and considerations of
using Cloud services. You will describe the differences between categories
of Cloud services, and you will describe the differences between
types of Cloud Computing. Let's dive right
into our case study. You work in the IT department
for Tailwind Traders, which has decided to migrate its applications and
data to Microsoft Azure. You're aware that
Cloud computing will save your company
time and money by migrating from your existing on-premises physical hardware
to a Cloud solution. With this new solution, you'll only need to pay for the resources and computing
time that you use. However, some of the
Cloud Computing Concepts are new to many members
of your IT staff. They've been asking
some specific questions about what Cloud computing
can do for them. For example, the team that manages Tailwind Traders website wants to know how Azure improves the site's availability
and scalability. The team that handles
the deployment of new hardware is curious to see how Cloud computing can make their deployment
processes faster. In addition, your developer
team wants to learn about the different
options available to them as they are designing
new applications. For example, is
there a way to run their applications in
a hybrid configuration where part of their
application runs on-premises and the rest of the application
runs in the Cloud? There are several benefits that a Cloud environment has over
a physical environment. For example, Cloud-based
applications employ a myriad of
related strategies. High availability. Depending on the service level
agreement that you choose, your Cloud-based
applications can provide a continuous user-experience
with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong. Scalability. Applications
in the Cloud can be scaled in two ways. Vertically, computing
capacity can be increased by adding RAM or
CPUs to a virtual machine. Horizontally,
computing capacity can be increased by adding
instances of a resource, such as adding more virtual machines to
your configuration. Elasticity. Cloud-based
applications can be configured to take advantage of auto-scaling so your applications will always have the resources they need. Agility. Cloud-based
resources can be deployed and configured quickly as your application
requirements change. Geo-distribution. Applications and data can be deployed to regional
data centers around the globe so your customers always have the best
performance in their region. Disaster recovery. By taking advantage of Cloud-based backup
services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your
applications with the confidence that
comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event that
disaster should occur. Cloud service providers operate on a consumption-based model, which means that end users only pay for the
resources that they use. Whatever they use is
what they pay for. A consumption-based
model has many benefits, including no upfront costs, no need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest, the ability to pay for additional resources
when they are needed, the ability to stop paying for resources that are
no longer needed. When analyzing the benefits
of Cloud computing, there are two different types of expenses that you
should consider; capital expenditure or CapEX, operational expenditure or OpEX. Capital expenditure or CapEx is the upfront spending of money
on physical infrastructure, and then deducting that
upfront expense over time. The upfront cost from CapEx has a value that
reduces over time. Operational expenditure or
OpEX is where you spend money on products or services and are build for them at
the moment of use. You can think of these as the day-to-day expenses that
are paid for immediately. In other words, when Tailwind Traders owns
its infrastructure, it buys equipment that goes onto its balance
sheets as assets. Because a capital
investment was made, accountants categorize
this transaction as a CapEx over time to account for the assets
limited useful lifespan, assets are depreciated
or amortized. Cloud services, on
the other hand, are categorized as an OpEx because of their
consumption model. There's no asset for
Tailwind Traders to amortize and it's Cloud
service provider, Azure, manages the costs that are associated with the purchase and lifespan of the
physical equipment. As a result, OpEx has a
direct impact on net profit, taxable income, and the associated expenses
on the balance sheet. To summarize, CapEx requires significant upfront
financial costs, as well as ongoing maintenance
and support expenditures. By contrast, OpEx is a
consumption-based model. Tailwind Traders is
only responsible for the cost of the computing
resources that it uses.
