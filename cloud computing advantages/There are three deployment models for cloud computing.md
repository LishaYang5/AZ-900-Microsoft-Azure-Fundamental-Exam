There are three deployment models for cloud computing. 

1. Public cloud, 
2. private cloud,
3.  and hybrid cloud. 

Each deployment model has different aspects that you should consider as you migrate to the cloud. 

In a public cloud, services are offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them. Cloud resources, such as servers and storage are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the Internet. A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site or on-premises data center. It can also be hosted by a third-party service provider. In the third model, hybrid cloud computing environments combine a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This image illustrates several of the cloud computing concepts that are presented in this unit. In this example, several factors are demonstrated when you were considering where to deploy a database server in a hybrid cloud environment. As your resources moved from on-premises to off-premises, your costs are reduced and your administration requirements decrease.
